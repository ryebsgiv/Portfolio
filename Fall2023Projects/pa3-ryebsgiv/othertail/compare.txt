I got the other tail program from chat gpt. It actually doesn't fully work. 
However, it does compile and there are some interesting ideas of stuff that it tries to do.
Firstly, instead of reading the characters to a dynamic array a character at a time like I do, 
it tries to read all of them into a single buffer and then write that buffer. I think that if their method was to work,
it would be more efficient since there would be less system calls overall. However, as I said before,
There method doesn't work. Interesting idea, but non-functioning so obviously it recieves pretty low marks.
