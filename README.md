# Portfolio
My name is Ben Givens and this is my portfolio of assignments created while getting my bachelors degree in computer science. 
The files are broken down into the various programing assignments that I made during my schooling. The crowning jewel of my experience would definitely be the game I created.
During that assignment I made a significant amount of graphical designs and sound design.
